# Copilot Instructions for Aetherwave

### **Overview for Autonomous Coding Agent**

You are contributing to the `Aetherwave` project‚Äîa media display engine for showcasing high-resolution MidJourney artwork across multiple monitors. This project is personal, cinematic, and minimalistic in nature. Your role is to **strictly scaffold and extend code within boundaries** defined in this instruction set.

### **‚úÖ Authorized Tasks**

- Create or modify files in:
  - `src/`
  - `config/`
  - `tests/`
  - `.github/`
- Perform metadata analysis on placeholder assets only
- Use SDL2 (C++) for rendering and graphics with hardware acceleration
- Use Python for classification logic
- Output only compilable or lint-clean code

### **‚ùå Forbidden Actions**

- Do NOT embed credentials or hardcoded file paths
- Do NOT auto-fetch or download assets
- Do NOT touch `.DS_Store`, `.env`, system settings, or user folders
- Do NOT alter `assets/` (read-only unless instructed)
- Do NOT use black-box AI models for classification (use colorthief, OpenCV, etc.)

### **üß† Memory & Documentation Management**

**Follow these steps for each interaction:**

1. **User Identification:**
   - Assume you are interacting with `default_user`.
   - If you have not identified `default_user`, proactively try to do so.
2. **Memory Retrieval:**
   - Always begin your chat by saying only "Remembering..." and retrieve all relevant business and technical information from your knowledge graph.
   - Always refer to your knowledge graph as your "memory".
3. **Memory Gathering:**
   - While conversing with the user, be attentive to any new information that falls into these categories:
     - **Business Decisions:** Key decisions made, the reasoning behind them, and any trade-offs or alternative solutions considered.
     - **Technical Information:** Design patterns, architectural decisions, and specific solutions that were tried and found not to work.
     - **Code-related Changes:** Any significant modifications to core business logic or API endpoints.
     - **Project Context:** Information about clients, project goals, and stakeholder feedback.
4. **Memory Update:**
   - If any new information was gathered during the interaction, update your memory as follows:
     - Create entities for recurring organizations, people, and significant project-related items.
     - Connect them to the current entities using relations (e.g., `decided_on`, `is_related_to`, `discovered_does_not_work`).
     - Store facts about them as observations, including the `timestamp` and, if possible, the `decision_maker`.

### **üìö Documentation Maintenance Protocol**

**Maintain living documentation that evolves with the project:**

1. **Business Decision Documentation:**

   - **ALWAYS** update `/docs/FEATURE_ROADMAP.md` when business decisions are made
   - Record the decision, reasoning, alternatives considered, and implementation timeline
   - Include confidence levels and success metrics for major architectural choices
   - Document trade-offs and potential future reconsiderations

2. **Technical Architecture Visibility:**

   - **ALWAYS** update this `copilot-instructions.md` file when:
     - New architectural patterns emerge
     - Key dependencies are added or changed
     - Development workflow changes
     - Testing strategies evolve
   - Replace placeholder sections as the codebase develops
   - Maintain current examples of key patterns and conventions

3. **Application Functionality Documentation:**

   - **ALWAYS** maintain up-to-date `README.md` files in each major directory (`src/`, `config/`, `tests/`)
   - Document how components work together, not just what they do
   - Include usage examples and integration patterns
   - Update API documentation when endpoints change

4. **Decision Audit Trail:**

   - **DUAL STORAGE**: Store all business decisions in both MCP memory AND documentation files
   - MCP memory for conversational context and relationship tracking
   - Documentation files for team onboarding and historical reference
   - Cross-reference between memory entities and documentation sections

5. **Documentation Quality Standards:**
   - **Accuracy**: Documentation must reflect current implementation, not future plans
   - **Completeness**: Every major component should have purpose, usage, and integration docs
   - **Accessibility**: Technical decisions should be understandable to future contributors
   - **Maintenance**: Documentation updates are part of every significant code change

### MCP Server Tools

- Please use Context7 to get the latest library documentation.
- Use Sequential Thinking to break down complex tasks into manageable steps.
- Use Memory to keep track of business decisions, technical information, and project context.
- Use Deepwiki to access detailed documentation and examples for specific libraries or frameworks. Use as backup to Context7.

### **üß† Coding Behavior Rules**

#### **C++**

- Use modern `C++17`
- All logic should be wrapped in `namespace Aetherwave`
- Split rendering logic and UI logic
- Use SDL2 for cross-platform graphics and window management
- Frame timing and sync via SDL2's VSync and timing functions
- No magic numbers‚Äîuse constants and config files

#### **Python**

- Fully typed using `typing`
- Include docstrings on every function
- API endpoints must return JSON with predictable structure
- Classification stubs should print sample metadata and write JSON only to `config/`
- Use `pytest` and maintain 90%+ test coverage

#### **General**

- Maintain max 80-char line width where possible
- Include summary comment blocks on each class
- Create PRs per feature. Tag with scope: `feature/display-mode-fade`, `bugfix/color-metadata`
- All `README.md` and `config.yaml` updates must be declared in PR notes

## Project Overview

Aetherwave is a content-driven media display engine for showcasing high-resolution MidJourney artwork across multiple monitors. The project evolved from hardcoded cyberfemme aesthetics to intelligent content analysis that automatically generates appropriate visual themes.

**Key Business Decision (August 3, 2025)**: Content-driven aesthetic adaptation enables universal reusability while preserving artistic vision. Cyberfemme artwork naturally drives cyberfemme interfaces, but the same system adapts to any art collection.

## Architecture & Structure

### **Core Components:**

- **Python Classification Engine** (`src/python/`): ColorThief + OpenCV analysis, FastAPI endpoints
- **C++ Display Engine** (`src/cpp/`): SDL2 rendering with 60 FPS multi-monitor support
- **Theme Management** (`src/shared/`): Content-to-theme mapping with statistical confidence
- **Configuration System** (`config/`): YAML-based settings with theme caching

### **Content-Driven Architecture:**

```
Image Collection ‚Üí Classification ‚Üí Theme Detection ‚Üí Visual Rendering
     ‚Üì               ‚Üì                ‚Üì               ‚Üì
