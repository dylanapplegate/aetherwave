## **üîß Troubleshooting**

### **üéÆ Unity Setup Issues**

**Check your Unity installation status:**

```bash
# Run comprehensive verification
./scripts/unity-verify.sh

# This will check:
# ‚úÖ Homebrew installation
# ‚úÖ Unity Hub installation
# ‚úÖ Unity 6.1 installation
# ‚úÖ Xcode Command Line Tools
# ‚úÖ System requirements (RAM, disk space, macOS version)
```

**Unity Hub won't install via Homebrew:**

```bash
# Update Homebrew first
brew update

# Install Unity Hub
brew install --cask unity-hub

# If that fails, try manual download
open https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
```

**Unity 6.1 not showing in Unity Hub:**

- Make sure you're looking at the "Official releases" tab in Unity Hub
- Unity 6.1 is the latest stable version with enhanced performance
- Look for version 6000.1.14f1 or newer

**Unity setup script can't find Unity installation:**

```bash
# Check Unity installation manually
ls /Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/

# Should show folders like: 2022.3.0f1, 2022.3.10f1, etc.
# If empty, reinstall Unity 6.1 through Unity Hub
```

**Unity project won't open:**

```bash
# Try opening Unity Hub first
open -a "Unity Hub"

# Then use the launcher script
./scripts/unity-run.sh

# Or open project manually in Unity Hub
# File -> Open -> Browse to src/unity/Aetherwave
```

**Unity asking for license:**

- Unity Personal is free for individual use
- Sign up for Unity ID when prompted
- Choose "Unity Personal" license
- No payment required for personal projects

### **üêç Python API Issues**

**Build fails with openFrameworks errors:**

```bash
# Clean rebuild everything
./scripts/cpp-setup.sh clean

# Or manually clean
rm -rf build libs/openFrameworks
./scripts/cpp-setup.sh
```

**Note**: The current C++ build system uses a test stub while openFrameworks integration is being finalized. The build and run scripts work correctly, and the foundation is ready for full openFrameworks integration.

**"No images loaded" message:**

- Add images to `assets/images/` directory in project root
- Rebuild to sync assets: `./scripts/cpp-setup.sh`
- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF
- Images are automatically synced from source to build during compilation

**Application won't start:**

- Check system requirements: `xcode-select --install` and `brew install cmake`
- Verify binary exists: `ls -la build/bin/Aetherwave`
- Run from correct directory: `cd build/bin && ./Aetherwave`

### **Docker/Python API Issues**

**Container fails to start with "unexpected character" or PYTHONPATH errors:**

```bash
# Rebuild containers after recent fixes
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

**Port 8000 already in use:**

```bash
# Stop existing services
./scripts/dev-stop.sh
# Or manually stop
docker-compose down
```

**Permission denied on scripts:**

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

**API not accessible from outside container:**

- Fixed: Python API now properly binds to 0.0.0.0 in Docker environment
- The API should be accessible at http://localhost:8000

## **üîí Privacy and Asset Handling**

- No cloud upload or syncing by default
- All assets remain local
- Docker containers only access mounted asset directories
- No personally identifying info should be embedded
