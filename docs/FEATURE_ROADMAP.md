# üé® Aetherwave Feature Roadmap

## Content-Driven Aesthetic Evolution

**Status**: Phase 4A Complete - Content-Adaptive Aesthetics Implemented
**Date**: August 3, 2025
**Current Version**: v2.1.0 (Content-Driven Themes)

---

## üéØ Vision Evolution: From Fixed to Adaptive Aesthetics

### üí° **Key Breakthrough**: Content-Driven Aesthetic Adaptation

Rather than hardcoding cyberfemme aesthetics, **Aetherwave now reads your content and automatically generates appropriate visual themes**. Your cyberfemme artwork will naturally drive cyberfemme aesthetics, while the same system can adapt to any art collection.

**This makes Aetherwave universally reusable while staying true to your artistic vision.**

### üê≥ **Development Infrastructure Decision (August 3, 2025)**

**Key Decision**: Docker-first development workflow for simplified onboarding and consistent environments.

**Reasoning**:

- Eliminates Python virtual environment setup complexity
- Ensures consistent development experience across different machines
- Simplifies dependency management for OpenCV and image processing libraries
- Enables easier collaboration with other developers
- Provides foundation for future deployment scenarios

**Implementation**:

- Multi-stage Dockerfile with development and production configurations
- One-command setup script (`./scripts/dev-setup.sh`) for instant environment creation
- Hot reload development with volume mounts for live code editing
- Manual setup preserved as alternative for developers needing customization

### üéÆ **Strategic Technology Pivot (August 4, 2025)**

**Key Decision**: Transition from SDL2/C++ to Unity for visual display engine while maintaining Python classification API.

**Reasoning**:

- **Development Velocity**: SDL2 requiring extensive low-level implementation blocking progress on core cyberfemme vision
- **Built-in Features**: Unity provides shader effects (chromatic aberration, bloom), multi-monitor support, audio sync out-of-the-box
- **Future-Proof Architecture**: Direct support for Phase 5+ features (audio sync, video integration, advanced effects)
- **Professional Quality**: Unity's rendering pipeline enables gallery-installation quality visuals
- **Proven Foundation**: Python API for content analysis and theme detection remains unchanged

**Migration Strategy**:

- **Phase 1**: Unity prototype with basic image display and multi-monitor support (1 week)
- **Phase 2**: Python API integration for theme-driven aesthetics (1 week)
- **Phase 3**: Cyberfemme shader effects and transitions (2 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Advanced features from roadmap (audio sync, video, control interface)

**Technical Benefits**:

- **Shader Pipeline**: Post-processing stack for cyberfemme effects (glitch, bloom, chromatic aberration)
- **Multi-Monitor**: Native display targeting with automatic coordination
- **Audio System**: Beat detection, waveform analysis, sync capabilities
- **UI Framework**: Professional control panels with immediate mode GUI
- **Performance**: Hardware-accelerated 60 FPS guaranteed across platforms
