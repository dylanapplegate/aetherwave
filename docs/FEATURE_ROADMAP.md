# üé® Aetherwave Feature Roadmap

## Content-Driven Aesthetic Evolution

**Status**: Phase 4A Complete - Content-Adaptive Aesthetics Implemented
**Date**: August 3, 2025
**Current Version**: v2.1.0 (Content-Driven Themes)

---

## üéØ Vision Evolution: From Fixed to Adaptive Aesthetics

### üí° **Key Breakthrough**: Content-Driven Aesthetic Adaptation

Rather than hardcoding cyberfemme aesthetics, **Aetherwave now reads your content and automatically generates appropriate visual themes**. Your cyberfemme artwork will naturally drive cyberfemme aesthetics, while the same system can adapt to any art collection.

**This makes Aetherwave universally reusable while staying true to your artistic vision.**

### üê≥ **Development Infrastructure Decision (August 3, 2025)**

**Key Decision**: Docker-first development workflow for simplified onboarding and consistent environments.

**Reasoning**:

- Eliminates Python virtual environment setup complexity
- Ensures consistent development experience across different machines
- Simplifies dependency management for OpenCV and image processing libraries
- Enables easier collaboration with other developers
- Provides foundation for future deployment scenarios

**Implementation**:

- Multi-stage Dockerfile with development and production configurations
- One-command setup script (`./scripts/dev-setup.sh`) for instant environment creation
- Hot reload development with volume mounts for live code editing
- Manual setup preserved as alternative for developers needing customization
